## Abstract
This project aims to create a machine-learning
model to forecast transit delays in the Toronto Transit Commission
(TTC) the public transportation system. By analyzing historical
data on incidents, routes, times, and other relevant features,
the project attempts to estimate delays for effective resource
allocation, better planning, and enhanced service quality. The
most efficient model is investigated using different machine
learning algorithms, such as time series analysis, regression, and
classification.

## INTRODUCTION
Public transport is the most efficient commuting method
within Toronto, and transit delays can significantly impact people’s
lives and society. The TTC comprises buses and subways,
and a delay of a few seconds can cause a delay in transfer,
which results in a catastrophic delay. By developing an accurate
and efficient model, we aim to enable transportation authorities
to make informed decisions, mitigate disruptions, and
enhance overall commuter experiences. Due to various factors,
the timing of trains and buses can be affected; sometimes,
there might be road brokerage, some accidents etc. Those
reasons can be major problems for many people. To understand
the delays of trains, we can use different machine learning
models on previous data, which find out some meaningful
information and patterns. Using these patterns, we can estimate
the timing of trains in the future. This kind of solution would
be a great help for all of us to get to our destined places.
The main objective is to predict Toronto Transit Commission
(TTC) service delays. Since it directly affects the everyday
lives of millions of commuters, delay prediction is an essential
component of public transportation systems. The paper aims
to improve the TTC’s effectiveness, dependability, and overall
user experience to become a more appealing and reliable
method of transportation for the neighbourhood.
